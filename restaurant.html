    <h1>Restaurant Menu UI Prototype</h1>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> UI Concept Design | <strong>Platform:</strong> Tablet/Desktop | <strong>Tool:</strong> Canva</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a digital restaurant menu UI prototype designed to improve the way customers view and access menu items for home delivery. The concept was inspired by a real local restaurant that currently shares a single PDF file containing all menu items in an unstructured format.

The goal was to redesign the experience into a cleaner, more organized, and visually accessible interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        The restaurant currently sends customers a single PDF document listing all food items together. The layout is cluttered and lacks clear separation between categories. Customers have to scroll through the entire document to find specific items, which makes the browsing experience confusing and inefficient.

There is no structured digital interface or website to present the menu in a user-friendly way.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        To design a clear and organized digital menu interface where items are separated into categories and presented in a visually structured format. The goal was to improve readability, simplify navigation, and create a more professional digital presence for the restaurant.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        The redesigned prototype organizes menu items into clearly defined sections based on categories. The layout focuses on:

Proper spacing between items

Clear headings for each food category

Balanced typography for readability

Visual hierarchy to highlight important sections

Clean alignment and structured grouping

This approach makes it easier for customers to quickly browse through items and find what they are looking for without confusion.

The design aims to simulate how a simple website or digital menu platform could look for small local restaurants.
    </p>
    <h2>Device Context</h2>
    <p>
        The prototype was designed for tablet and desktop viewing to simulate a digital menu interface that customers could access online for home delivery or restaurant browsing.
    </p>
    <h2>Tool Used</h2>
    <p>
        Canva (UI Layout & Visual Design)
    </p>
